# My Hacker Journey
---

Welcome to my hacker journey. I am writing this at the begining of my journey but will be adding to this as I grow. Sorry now for the spelling errors and puncuation mistakes Vim dosn't seem to have spell check at this moment in MY journey.

I installed Linux on a vitural machine on a comupter with plenty of room and it went great!!!  I also tryed to do the same on my mac book with almost no room and it did not go as well. Will learn and try again. Vim isnt so bad people like to talk a lot of trash.

    I think I am going to change the format for README entrys to be more like this. This way I have the date and can look back on where I was and at what time...Today I fixed the fact that I uploaded my weather api keys to GitHub like a looser. Time to relearn how to save keys as env variables but this time in bash.
This has been fun so far. I am ready to dive into actually doing something and not just learning theroy but at the same time I dont want to break something I cant fix yet or hack something I wasnt alowed to yet and get caught. I plan to by July be ready for the advanced stuff, writing my own scripts, and useing tools.
