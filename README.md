# My Hacker Journey
---

Welcome to my hacker journey. I am writing this at the begining of my journey but will be adding to this as I grow. Sorry now for the spelling errors and puncuation mistakes Vim dosn't seem to have spell check at this moment in MY journey.

I installed Linux on a vitural machine on a comupter with plenty of room and it went great!!!  I also tryed to do the same on my mac book with almost no room and it did not go as well. Will learn and try again. Vim isnt so bad people like to talk a lot of trash.
